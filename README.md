# Spotify-Clone
A project using HTML(for frontend design), CSS(for adding design and texture) and JavaScript(for backend)
This is my first project, It's a music player clone where user can listen to "n" numbers of music listed at backend.
User can navigate to next/previous song.
User can use play a particular song from the lists i.e; listed there by clicking on play button of that song.
